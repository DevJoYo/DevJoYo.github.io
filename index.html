                            My goal is to become a Software Developer and create something to make everyday life easier for the people around the world, ether with a useful applications or a soul capturing game.
                            To reach this goal I have enrolled at Mohawk College where I am currently in my fourth semester and on my way to achieving an advanced diploma.
                            In my spare time I enjoy playing soccer, hockey and a variety of games. Nothing beats watching a few lines of code grow to a complex problem solver.

                                    Throughout my life I have tried my hand at many different careers, ranging from the automotive industry to horticulture production and many jobs inbetween.
                                    These experiences have given me the skills to work both independently and with others, to quickly and efficiently carry out day to day tasks and solve problems.
                                    Now, at 30 years old, I have returned to college to pursue a career in Software Development, following my passion for technology.

                                This simple JavaFx program was the result of a canceled assignment in my second semester. Due to it being a summer semester the proffesors were swapped six weeks in,
                                however I had already started making this and was enjoying the challenge, so I decided to finish it in my free time.

                              <p>
                                This program allows you to simulate playing blackjack against a dealer. The cards are dealt at random and the cards that are left in the deck are tracked in a side panel
                                (it counts cards for you, so you should win...). The program also keeps track of how many hands you have won so you can try for a high score. Every time the dealer wins you lose 
                                a life, and the game ends when you run out of lives.

                                This is a pretend project that I have not yet worked on but I have been thinking of using the skills I've learned at mohawk to make this application for my partner
                                to use at her job.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                This application would allow a user to select the type of animal they were working with, enter information about the animal (weight, breed, etc) and select which 
                                drug they are administering, and provide the correct dosage. This would be incredible helpful as veterinary technicians often have to do complex conversions between 
                                volume and weight as each drug has strict dosage requirements. I believe a web application would be the most benifical way to ship this application, as the technicians
                                could load it on their phones or tablets as long as they had an internet connection.
